2. **Loading States:** Consider adding loading indicators during AI command execution

### Low Priority
1. **Animation Enhancements:** Current animations are functional; could be enhanced for more polish

## Conclusion

The BasiliskAI website demonstrates strong foundational functionality with an impressive code editor interface and working AI command palette. The primary concern is the incomplete implementation of demo control buttons, which are central to showcasing the product's capabilities. With the identified issues addressed, this would be a highly effective demonstration platform for the AI-powered development tool.

**Overall Assessment:** Good foundation with critical demo functionality gaps that need immediate attention.
