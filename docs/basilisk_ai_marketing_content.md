# BasiliskAI Marketing Content

Minimal. Open source.
BasiliskAI makes AI a first-class citizen in your coding environment — not a clunky afterthought.

Your design isn't just seen — it's felt. From landing pages to dashboards, you describe your vision in plain language and Basilisk instantly spins up a functional, interactive app. Product managers, marketers, stakeholders — anyone — can turn ideas into working interfaces. No more dev handoffs, context loss, or "this doesn't look like the mock." You shape interactions in real time.

## Core Features

### 1. The AI knows your codebase.

Basilisk indexes your entire repo — folder structure, imports, dependencies, quirks and all. Say "Add a dark mode toggle" and it updates every relevant file, keeping the system in sync.

### 2. Edits like a real teammate.

Select code, hit Cmd+K, say what you want. Basilisk rewrites inline, preserving formatting, comments, and style. You review the diff, approve, done. No copy-paste. No formatting purgatory.

### 3. Works at scale.

Multi-file reasoning means a one-hour refactor across 15 files becomes one AI command. Imports, types, and naming stay consistent everywhere.

### 4. Flow stays unbroken.

Basilisk lives inside your IDE and your command palette. It's as native as "Find and Replace" or "Git Commit." No browser tabs, no context switching.

### 5. You ship faster, with full control.

Every change is a diff you can inspect. Full Git history. Easy reverts. AI speed, human judgment.

**If VS Code is a workshop, Basilisk is the expert apprentice who's read your whole codebase, knows your tech stack, and works at the speed of thought.**

## The UX hard-sell:

**Basilisk is the closest thing to Figma for live apps.**
You're not mocking experiences — you're delivering them. The gap between concept and code disappears.

⸻

🚀 **Instant reality check**
Wireframes lie. In Basilisk, your idea is a real app the same day you sketch it. No "handoff" — just a URL.

🤝 **Design jam sessions**
Everyone's in the file, watching the product evolve live — colors, layouts, logic — as you talk. You're all building together.

🔁 **User testing without lag**
Testers use a real interface, not a clickable illusion. You see exactly how it behaves under real human chaos — and can ship fixes before they leave the room.

🛠 **The dev environment disappears**
No Git merges, Node versions, or server setup. You shape products like you shape layouts in Figma or Miro.

⚡ **Practical AI**
"Make the nav sticky and animate the dropdown" — done, live. Not a snippet, not a suggestion — a real change in the running app.

## Bottom line:
Basilisk turns UX work from blueprints into buildings. Your team feels the real thing early enough to fix what matters — before it's baked into release.
